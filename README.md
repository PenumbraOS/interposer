# Ai Pin Interposer

An interposer is a device that allows you to connect to the Ai Pin over ADB + USB. This unlocks the device for additional uses such as openPin's projects.

We have two different endorsed mechanisms for obtaining an interposer:

## PCB (Recommended)

This option is the recommended interposer solution due to its high quality and ease of construction. It does require fabrication of a PCB and fine SMD soldering ability.

## Full DIY (Easiest)

This option is able to be built completely DIY (with the help of a 3D printer). It requires fine soldering ability, but less than that required by SMD components.
